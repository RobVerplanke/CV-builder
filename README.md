## Project Overview

- **Practical Experience Section**: Add, edit, and display practical experience such as company name, position title, main responsibilities, and employment dates.

## Requirements

- **React Components**: Organize the application into components.
  - Create a components directory under the src directory for all components.
  - Create a styles directory under the src directory for CSS files.
- **Forms and Display**: Each section must have forms for adding and editing information, as well as a display component to show the entered data.
- **State Management**: Use React state and props to manage the data flow between components.
- **Buttons**: Include an edit and submit button for each section to toggle between form input and data display.
